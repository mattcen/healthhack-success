## Listen to problem owner pitches
--

## Choose your project

* Read detailed problem descriptions
* Ask problem owners questions
* Look for somthing you're interested in or passionate about

Note:

The problems will be posted around the room om big sheets of paper. Read them through, and find one that appeals to you. Chat with the problem owner if you need clarification. Put your name down on the sheet so we know who's working on what.
--

## Choose your team

* Discuss your skill with others interested in the problem
* Endeavour to create a diverse team
* Designer/UI/UX, Developer, Storyteller, Project Manager

Note:

Chat with other potential team members. You're looking for different types of people; it's no use if you're all developers if nobody can see the big picture or make the project user-friendly. Find designers, project managers, etc.

## Refine the problem

* Problem owners generally medical experts, not computer scientists
* Gather functional requirements
* Consider prior art that may be useful
* Limit scope. You've got less than 48 hours!

Note:

Keep in mind your time constraints. You want *something* to deliver by the end of the weekend. Refine the functional requirements to get to the heart of the problem. Work out the where the best trade-off is; the least amount of work for the biggest value, and decide how to make that most viable within the timeframe.

Some of the problems may be closely fitted by ready made solutions. Look for existing tools, ideally open source, that you can tweak or write plugins/modules for in order to do what you want.
